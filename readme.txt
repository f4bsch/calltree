== Description ==

 
== Installation ==

Make sure that the folder `wp-content/mu-plugins` is writable. Calltree will install a Must-Use plugin `hook-profiler.php`.

If you want to give write access to `wp-content/mu-plugins`, just copy `mu-plugins/hook-profiler.php` to that folder.

Activate and you'll see Calltree in the Toolbar (Admin menu bar).
